# YouTube Subscriptions Tansfer

This is a python script that uses the Youtube Data API to help you transfer all subscriptions from one youtube channel to another account.

Retrieving subscriptions from a channel doesn't require authentication, just the channel Id. The channel Id can be retrieved from the *settings* -> *advanced settings* page on youtube if the channel is yours or from the channel page URL from all youtube channels.

To subscribe to channels you will need to authenticate to the subscribing account using OAUTH2 (A google authentication website URL will be generated by this script).

## Requirements

* Python installation and PIP install all required packages (`requirements.txt`)
* An API Key that can be retrieved from the [google developer console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
* An OAuth 2.0 Client ID to allow user authentication calls
* Registration of the subscribing user account as a testing account in your developer console project page

## Instructions

* Install all dependencies `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Create a new project in the google developer console and enable the YouTube Data API v3
* Create a new API Key in the credentials page of your project, save it in a file named API_TOKEN.txt
* Create an Oauth2 Desktop client Id in the credentials page of your project, download as json and rename to `client_secret_file.json`
* On the project OAuth consent screen
    * Enable the following scopes: 
        * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly`
        * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube`
        * `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl`
    * Add your google account to the test users list
* Run the script and follow the instructions

## Youtube Data API quotas

The default quota for the Youtube Data API is 10,000 daily requests. Each subscription request has a cost of 50, so there is a limit on how many subscriptions you can transfer in a day. If you hit this limit, wait 24 hours and run the script again to transfer remaining subscriptions. Do as many times as needed.
